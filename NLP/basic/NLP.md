# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## What is Naural Language Processing

Natural language processing is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.(from Wikipedia)

NLP is the result of mathematical science studies on human language. NLP is a computer science that aims to listen, analyze, understand (understand language rules), analyze (reconstruct language rules) and eventually speak by machines. As technology evolved, NLP's ability to do its goals has increased.

NLP works in two basic ways. Text processing and speech processing. The most well-known NLP workspaces and their real-life applications.

Search Engines (Google, Yahoo etc.)
Auto Predict by Search Engines
Santiment Analysis
Machine Translator (Auto translator: Google Translate)
Creating Text Summarization
Spech Recognations (Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistan)
Spam Filter (Finding Spam mail by Mail,gmail etc.) 
NLP Generation
 
"Named Entity Recognation (NER)"
"""NER is working for recognation real/sepacial names in English. For example London is a  physical place/city name, NER know it is. Other features: people nmes, company names, geographic locations (both of physical and polotical), product names, special date and times, amounts of money, event nemes."""

## NLP Libraries
1-NLTK
NLTK is a library pool that offers solutions to many different topics for natural language processing. Thanks to NLTK, you can easily process / analyze text, tag, extract information ... It has over 50 compilation and dictionary resources (such as WordNet). It provides an easy-to-use interface for the text processing library set for classification, sentence or word extraction from text, word root finding, parsing, labeling and semantic extraction.

2-SpaCy
SpaCy is a natural language processing library containing beautiful samples, API documents and sample applications. It supports more than 30 languages. It also provides easy integration into today's popular subject, Deep Learning. It has an architecture designed to process the entire document without converting it into sentences.

3-Gensim
Gensim is a library developed for semantic analysis, subject modeling, vector space modeling. It is based on Numpy and Scipy. It offers an implementation of popular NLP algorithms such as Word2vec. Although it has an advanced library for word representation, it has a library called fasttext for effective learning of word impressions. It is a feature that can be used by those who are thinking about doing a study on Turkish about word representation.
