; This file contains a list of POSITIVE opinion words (or sentiment words).
;
; This file and the papers can all be downloaded from 
;    http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html
;
; If you use this list, please cite one of the following two papers:

;
; Notes: 
;    1. The appearance of an opinion word in a sentence does not necessarily  
;       mean that the sentence expresses a positive or negative opinion. 
;       See the paper below:
;
;       Bing Liu. "Sentiment Analysis and Subjectivity." An chapter in 
;          Handbook of Natural Language Processing, Second Edition, 
;          (editors: N. Indurkhya and F. J. Damerau), 2010.
;
;    2. You will notice many misspelled words in the list. They are not 
;       mistakes. They are included as these misspelled words appear 
;       frequently in social media content.

;
; This file and the papers can all be downloaded from 
;    http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html
;
; If you use this list, please cite one of the following two papers:
;
;   Minqing Hu and Bing Liu. "Mining and Summarizing Customer Reviews." 
;       Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge 
;       Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-2004), Aug 22-25, 2004, Seattle,

;
; Notes: 
;    1. The appearance of an opinion word in a sentence does not necessarily  
;       mean that the sentence expresses a positive or negative opinion. 
;       See the paper below:
;
;       Bing Liu. "Sentiment Analysis and Subjectivity." An chapter in 
;          Handbook of Natural Language Processing, Second Edition, 
;          (editors: N. Indurkhya and F. J. Damerau), 2010.
;
;    2. You will notice many misspelled words in the list. They are not 
;       mistakes. They are included as these misspelled words appear 
;       frequently in social media content.

;
; This file contains a list of POSITIVE opinion words (or sentiment words).
;
; This file and the papers can all be downloaded from 
;    http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html
;
; If you use this list, please cite one of the following two papers:
;
;   Minqing Hu and Bing Liu. "Mining and Summarizing Customer Reviews." 
;       Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge 
;       Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-2004), Aug 22-25, 2004, Seattle, 
;       Washington, USA, 
;   Bing Liu, Minqing Hu and Junsheng Cheng. "Opinion Observer: Analyzing

;       2005, Chiba, Japan.
;
; Notes: 
;    1. The appearance of an opinion word in a sentence does not necessarily  
;       mean that the sentence expresses a positive or negative opinion. 
;       See the paper below:
;
;       Bing Liu. "Sentiment Analysis and Subjectivity." An chapter in 
;          Handbook of Natural Language Processing, Second Edition, 
;          (editors: N. Indurkhya and F. J. Damerau), 2010.
;
;    2. You will notice many misspelled words in the list. They are not 
;       mistakes. They are included as these misspelled words appear 
;       frequently in social media content.

Nothing

The

perplexing
This

And
boring
tired

Why

made
The

ultra
cheap
look
The
result
film
look
right
None
engaging
exciting
The
plot
nonsense
interest
slightest

The
Foreigner
worth

How
piece
